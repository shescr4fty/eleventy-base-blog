## Better with every loop...

During this task I created a simple loop to calculate seven times tables with the string output to the page. 

I also created an array within an object which included the ingedients, equipment and directions to make my favourite Ameretto and Lime Jelly shots! I created a function which looped through the array within the object to push the recipe to the webpage.

## My math teacher called me average! How mean...

For this task I learnt how to apply discounts to item costs in my shopping cart array which had a specific "type" assigned. 

I also learnt how to work out the mean, median and mode of numbers within an array using loops.
