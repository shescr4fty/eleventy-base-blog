## I'm now a functioning JS coder...

In this task I created a basic function with two arguments, first and last name (generated by a prompt imput) and used the "document.write" method to push a sentence to the page using the argument. 

I also created a function which used an "else if" statement to specify temperature conditions to output suggested clothing choices.

## JavaScript is calculating...

For this task I learnt how to use switch statements to create a simple JavaScript calculator.
