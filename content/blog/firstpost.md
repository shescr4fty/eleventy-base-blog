Thank you for visiting my page and joining me on my web design and development journey! 

## My journey so far...

My interest in web design and development first started when I came accross the Free Code Camp website, which offers short training courses in html and css. 

After completing a few of their lessons, I was keen to learn more and found that The Coders Guild offer an 8 week Skills Bootcamp Course in Web Design and Development. 

I'll keep you all posted with my progress here on my blog page.
