During The Coders Guild Bootcamp session on 11th September, we were introduced to JavaScript. 

I learnt about variables/ data types, the console and arithmetic operators. I also learnt the importance of breaking instructions down into simple precise actions when using JavaScript.  

Following this session, we were tasked with creating a tip calculator which generated an output to our webpage, using variables for the pre-tip total and the desired tip percentage.

At first I found JavaScript a little difficult to get my head around, but with practice and by putting my methodiacal skills to good use it is making much more sense. I am determined to become a JS pro!
